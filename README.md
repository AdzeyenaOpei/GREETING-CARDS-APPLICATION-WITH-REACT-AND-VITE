# React + Vite

# Greeting Cards Application

## Project Overview
The Greeting Cards application is a React-based project designed to practice component-based architecture and prop usage. Built using Vite for efficient project scaffolding and Tailwind CSS for styling, the application demonstrates modular UI design.  

The project comprises three functional components:
1. Header: Displays the main heading, "Welcome to Greeting Cards."  
2. GreetingCard: A reusable component that accepts `title` and `message` as props to display personalized cards.  
3. App: The main component that defines the card data and renders multiple instances of the GreetingCard component with unique props.  

This project focuses on dynamic rendering through props, clean UI design with Tailwind CSS, and efficient project setup with Vite. Example outputs include greeting cards such as "Happy Birthday!", "Congratulations!", and "Thank You!", each styled and presented dynamically.
